# respondnow

# Ideas:
- dispatcher needs to enter a location, symptoms, context
- push this out to first responders within a certain radius - radius could be basically how far EMT is from 
- three "logins/users": dispatcher, patient, first responder
- dispatcher or first responder needs to be verified
## dispatcher
- enter a location, patient, symptoms, context
- do this via typing or voice
- send this info to a radius of first responders
- message a responder
- show where the dispatcher is
## first responder
- receives a notification for an emergency that they are near
- click the emergency if they are responding
- get a navigation to the location
- shows if they arrived
- message the dispatcher
- show where the responder is
- change icon color if they are responding
## patient
- call EMT and record the info simultaneously
- notifies for nearby first responders
